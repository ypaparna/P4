###Review data structure
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str(wa_2008)
```
###Summary of the data structure
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(wa_2008)
```

###Remove the data not needed for analysis
  - Remove refunds and reattributions to avoid double counting
  - Subset columns 3 through 11 for analysis.

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

wa_subset <- subset(wa_2008,  (wa_2008$memo_cd != 'X' ) & 
                      (wa_2008$contb_receipt_amt >0))

```
###Review the data structure 
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str(wa)
```
###Summary of the dataset and explore candidates
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(wa)
table(wa$cand_nm)
```
###Remove candidates who have received less than 500 contributions
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
wa <- subset(wa, !(wa$cand_nm %in% c("Hunter, Duncan", "Gilmore, James S III", 
                                     "Cox, John H","Gravel, Mike",
                                     "Dodd, Christopher J",
                                     "Biden, Joseph R Jr",

                                     "Tancredo, Thomas Gerald" )))
##Adjust levels 
wa <- droplevels(wa)

```
###Clean up zipcode(contbr_zip) column by keeping only first five characters 
and display the top 6 zipcodes where the most number of donations came from.
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
wa$contbr_zip <- substr(wa$contbr_zip, 0, 5)
wa <- subset(wa, !is.na(wa$contbr_zip))
head((sort(table(wa$contbr_zip), decreasing=TRUE)))

```

###Change the following Column types
  -- Change candidate name(cand_nm) from factor to character
  -- change zipcode(contbr_zip) from factor to numeric
  -- change contribution date (contb_receipt_dt) from factor to date
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
wa$contbr_nm <- as.character(wa$contbr_nm)
wa$contbr_zip <- as.numeric(wa$contbr_zip)
wa$contb_receipt_dt <- as.Date(wa$contb_receipt_dt, format = "%d-%B-%y")
```

###Add two additional columns
 -- party column based on the candidate name and gender column based on the 
 contributor's first name
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
getParty <- function(x) {
  if(is.na(x)){
    NA
  }else if(x == "Bachmann, Michele" | x == "Cain, Herman" | x == "Paul, Ron" 
           |x=='Brownback, Samuel Dale'|x=='Romney, Mitt'
           | x=='Giuliani, Rudolph W' |x=='McCain, John S'
           | x=='Thompson, Fred Dalton' | x=='Huckabee, Mike' ){
    "R"
  }else if(x == "Obama, Barack" | x=='Edwards, John' | x== 'Richardson, Bill'
           | x== 'Kucinich, Dennis J'|x=='Clinton, Hillary Rodham'  ){
    "D"
  }else{
    NA
  }
}

# Create New Variable of Party Affiliation (Using cand_nm)
wa$party <- apply(wa['cand_nm'],1,getParty)

###Split name into first name and Last name

wa <- extract(wa, contbr_nm, c("LastName","FirstName"),
              "(.*),\\s*(\\S*)\\s*.*", fill="left",perl=TRUE)

###using gender package and first name predict the gender
gender <- gender(wa$FirstName, c(1932,1998),
                 method= "ssa", countries = "United States")
gender <- unique(gender)
names(gender)[1] = "FirstName"
###merge gender column with the original dataframe
wa <- merge(wa, gender[, c("FirstName", "gender")])
wa$gender <- as.factor(wa$gender)
wa$party <- as.factor(wa$party)
```
###Verify the final data structure
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
str(wa)
```
WA state 2008 election dataset is ready for Analysis: It contains 130353 
observations and 12 variables.
  -- Two new columns (party, gender) were added to the orginal dataset to help 
      with exploration
  -- Removed variables that were not helpful for analysis
  
###Summary of the variables and total $ contributed by gender:
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(wa)
tapply(wa$contb_receipt_amt,wa$gender, sum )
```


#Univariate Analysis

```{r}
ggplot(aes(x=contb_receipt_amt), data = subset(wa,contb_receipt_amt>0))+
  geom_histogram( bins = 30, color='black',fill='light blue')+scale_x_log10()+
#  geom_histogram(binwidth = 25, color='black',fill='light blue')+
 # scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,600), breaks=seq(0,600,50))+
  xlab("Contribution Amout on log10 scale")+
  ylab("Number of contributions")

```

In general most contributions falls between 10 and 1000. However, there are few
outliers with below $10 donations and above $1000 donations. Since these are few
numbers, we can focus and take a closer look for donations below $1000.
We can explore that with the below histogram


```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(wa, aes(x=contb_receipt_amt))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 25, color='black',fill='light blue')+
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,1000), breaks=seq(0,1000,50))+
  xlab("Contribution Amout")+
  ylab("Number of contributions")

```

We can conclude from the above histogram that most contributions are for $25, 
$100 followed by $250.  Few people made contributions above $250.


```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p1<- ggplot(wa, aes(x=cand_nm)) +
  geom_histogram(stat= "count",color='black',fill='light blue')+
  geom_text(stat='count',aes(label=..count..),vjust=-1)+
  xlab("Candidate Name")+
  ylab("Number of Contributions received")+
  scale_y_continuous(limit= c(0,110000))
p1+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

Above histogram shows that Barack Obama received significantly more number of 
contributions than any other candidate.
Next highest number of contributions were received by Hillary Clinton.

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(wa, aes(x=party)) +
  geom_histogram(stat= "count",color='black',fill='light blue')+
  geom_text(stat='count',aes(label=..count..),vjust=-1)+
  xlab("Party")+
  ylab("Number of Contributions received")+
  scale_y_continuous(limit= c(0,125000))
```

Democrats received at least 8 times more number of contributions than 
republicans in the state of WA. WA is typically a liberal state, so the data 
is not surprising.


```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(wa, aes(x=gender)) +
  geom_histogram(stat= "count",color='black',fill='light blue')+
  geom_text(stat='count',aes(label=..count..),vjust=-1)+
  xlab("Gender")+
  ylab("Number of Contributions received")+
  scale_y_continuous(limit= c(0,80000))

```

Number of Contributions from both males and females is almost equal


```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(wa, aes(contb_receipt_dt)) + geom_histogram(bins = 24,color='black',
                                                   fill='light blue')+
  xlab("Contribution date")+
  ylab("Number of contributions received")

```

This is a negatively skewed distribution indicating most contributions came as 
the general election was getting close. In 2007 when candidates declared their 
intent to run, they started receiving contributions but in low numbers. 
Significant number of contributions came after primaries and national 
conventions are done.



# Univariate Analysis

### What is the structure of your dataset?
WA state 2008 election contributions dataset contains 130353 observations and 
12 variables.
Other observations:
-Most contributions went to Democrats
-Median donation is $25
-Almost equal number of males and females donated to 2008 elections in WA state.
-Males donated a total of $13 million +
-Females donated a total of $9 million+
-Democrats received 115,000 + contributions
-Republicans received 14,000 + contributions

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
  Main features of interest for analysis is the size and number of 
  contributions.
  Number of contributions received by party
  Number of contributions received by each candidate
### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your
investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

  Zipcodes impact on contributions
  Gender impact on contributions
### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?

I created two new variables in the dataset.
party - Candidate name is used to identify party for each record.  This will
help to analyze contributions by party.
gender - I split the contributor's name into first name and last name.  
With the help of gender package and utilizing the first name, I predicted
the contributor's gender.  This will help to analyze gender influence on the 
contributions and support for a candidate.

###Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did
###you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of 
###the data? If so, why did you do this?


# Bivariate Analysis

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p1 <-ggplot(aes(x=cand_nm, y=contb_receipt_amt), data =wa)+
  geom_point(alpha=1/10, position= position_jitter(h=0), color='orange')+
  coord_cartesian( ylim=c(0,2500))+
  geom_line(stat = 'summary', fun.y = mean, group =1,color = 'blue')+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
  xlab("Candidate Name")+
  ylab("Amount per contribution")
  #geom_line(stat = 'count')


p2 <- ggplot(aes(x=cand_nm, y=contb_receipt_amt), 
       data=subset(wa, !is.na(contbr_zip)))+
  geom_boxplot(fill='#A4A4A4', color="darkblue")+
  coord_cartesian( ylim=c(0,2500))+
 stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom = 'point', shape =4)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
   xlab("Candidate Name")+
  ylab("Amount per contribution")

grid.arrange(p1,p2, nrow=1)
```

Above plost show that most contributions are below $250.  Also the line 
representing mean contributions by candidate shows John McCain and Mitt Romney
(Republican candidates) have higher means than Hillary Clinton and 
Barack Obama (Democratic candidates).  

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=party, y=contb_receipt_amt), data =wa)+
  geom_point(alpha=1/20, position= position_jitter(h=0), color='orange')+
  coord_cartesian( ylim=c(0,2500))+
  geom_line(stat = 'summary', fun.y = mean, group =1,color = 'blue')+
 # theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
  xlab("Party")+
  ylab("Amount per contribution")
  #geom_line(stat = 'count')
```

Democrats received significantly more number of contributions than Republicans. 
Mean contribution amount is around $125 for Democrats and little above $250 for 
Republicans.

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=gender, y=contb_receipt_amt), data =wa)+
  geom_jitter(alpha=1/20, position= position_jitter(h=0), color='orange')+
  coord_cartesian( ylim=c(0,2500))+
  geom_line(stat = 'summary', fun.y = mean, group =1,color = 'blue')+
 # theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
  xlab("Gender")+
  ylab("Amount per contribution")
  #geom_line(stat = 'count')
```

There is not a significant difference in number of contributions based on gender. 

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=cand_nm, y=contb_receipt_amt), 
       data=subset(wa, !is.na(contbr_zip)))+
  geom_boxplot(fill='#A4A4A4', color="darkblue")+
  scale_y_continuous(limit= c(0,250), breaks=seq(0,250,25))+
 stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom = 'point', shape =4)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
   xlab("Candidate Name")+
  ylab("Amount per contribution")
```

For most candidates their mean contribution received is higher than the mode.



```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=party, y=contb_receipt_amt), data=subset(wa, !is.na(contbr_zip)))+
  geom_boxplot(fill='#A4A4A4', color="darkblue")+
  scale_y_continuous(limit= c(0,250), breaks=seq(0,250,25))+
 stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom = 'point', shape =4)+
  xlab("Party")+
  ylab("Amount per contribution")
```

Both median and mean are higher for Republican party for the amount per 
contribution. Here x indicates the mean.
This shows that even though overall number of contributions are lower for 
Republican party, amounts per contribution are higher.

###Data transformation - summarize contributions by candidate

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
wag1 <- group_by (wa, cand_nm)
wa.by_candnm <- summarise(wag1, contribution_mean=mean(contb_receipt_amt),  contribution_median=median(contb_receipt_amt),
contribution_total=sum(contb_receipt_amt),
n=n())
arrange(wa.by_candnm, cand_nm )
```

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
 ggplot(aes(x=cand_nm, y=contribution_mean), data=wa.by_candnm)+
  geom_bar(aes(), group=1 ,stat="identity", color='black',fill= 'light blue',
           position='dodge')+
  ylab("Contribution mean")+
  xlab("Candidate Name")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust=1))
```

MItt Romney received the highest contribution means followed by John McCain.  
Barack Obama's mean is lower than most of his democratic peers.

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=cand_nm, y=contribution_total/1000000), data=wa.by_candnm)+
  geom_bar(aes(), group=1 ,stat="identity", color='black',fill= 'light blue',
           position='dodge')+
  ylab("Total contributions received in millions" )+
  xlab("Candidate Name")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))

```

Overall Barack Obama received around $15 millions in total contributions even
though his mean contributions are much lower than most of the other candidates.  
Hillary Clinton received around $2.5 millions.

###create time series object with summarized monthly contributions
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ts <- xts(wa$contb_receipt_amt, as.Date(wa$contb_receipt_dt, "%d-%B-%y"))
# convert daily data
ts_m = apply.monthly(ts, FUN='sum')
ts_m

```

The above table shows contributions ($) received by month.


```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tidy(ts_m) %>% ggplot(aes(x=index,y=value/1000000)) + geom_line(color='red')+
  scale_x_date(date_labels = '%b-%Y',date_breaks = "2 month",
               limits= as.Date(c("2007-01-01", "2008-12-01")))+
  xlab('Reporting period') +
  ylab('Contribution in millions')+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=(as.numeric(as.Date("2008-08-01")))))+
geom_vline(aes(xintercept=(as.numeric(as.Date("2008-02-01")))))
```

There are two peaks in contriutions.  The first one is right after WA primary is
done end of February. And again the contributions started going up after the 
national convention is done in August reaching a peak in October.  Two vertical 
lines represent WA primaries and National conventions respectively.



#Bivariate Analysis
###Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the 
###investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features
###in the dataset?
Mean contribution amount for Republicans is higher compared to Democrats.  
This might be due to upper class leaning towards conservatives and middle class
leaning towards liberals.

Both males and females equally participated in election contributions.

### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features?
Most of the contributions received were below $250.  

$50 is the mode for contributions received by democrats whereas $100 is the
mode for Republican contributions.

The general election candidates, John McCain received total 8,143 contributions
and Barack Obama received 96,902 which is almost 12 times more contributions 
than his Republican counterpart.

Contribution totals for Barack Obama is $15 million, where as John McCain 
received a total of $2.3 million.

Contributions reached peak in October 2008 just before the election.


### What was the strongest relationship you found?
Strongest relationship is between party and the number of contributions 
received. Since WA is liberal leaning state, it is no surprise there are 
significantly more number of contributions made to democrats than Republicans.


#Multivariate plots

###Summarize data by candidate name and contributor's gender

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
####summary table using dplyr arranged by gender and cand_nm
wag2 <- group_by (wa, cand_nm, gender)
wa.by_candnm_gender <- summarise(wag2, 
                                 contribution_mean=mean(contb_receipt_amt), contribution_median=median(contb_receipt_amt),
                                 contribution_total=sum(contb_receipt_amt),
                                 n=n())
arrange(wa.by_candnm_gender, cand_nm,gender )
```
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
##reshaping summary data -- 
wag2.wide <- dcast(wa.by_candnm_gender, cand_nm ~ gender, 
                   value.var='contribution_total')
wag2.wide
```

```{r}
totals = wa.by_candnm_gender$contribution_total/1000000
ggplot(aes(x=cand_nm, y=(contribution_total/1000000)), 
       data=wa.by_candnm_gender)+
  geom_bar(aes(fill=gender), group=1 ,stat="identity", position='dodge')+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
  xlab("Candidate Name")+
  ylab("Contribution totals in millions")
```

Out of all the people contributed to each candidate, females outweigh males for 
Hillary and vice versa for Barack Obama and all other male candidates.

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=cand_nm,y=female/male), data=wag2.wide)+
  geom_line(group=1, color='red')+
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0.2,1.6), breaks=seq(0.2,1.6,0.2))+
  geom_hline(yintercept=1, alpha=1, linetype=5)+
  xlab("Candidate Name")+
  ylab("Proportion of female to male donations")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))
```

Proportion of female to male donations are depicted in the above plot. 
Hillary clinton has 1.5 times more female contributors than male. All other 
candidates had more male contributors than female.


```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=cand_nm, y=n), data=wa.by_candnm_gender)+
  geom_bar(aes(fill=gender), group=1 ,stat="identity", position='dodge')+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+
  xlab("Candidate Name")+
  ylab("Number of contributions received")
```

This line plot shows us number of contributions received from males vs females 
for each candidate.  Hillary Clinton received more contributions from females 
compared to males.


```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=cand_nm, y=contb_receipt_amt), data=wa)+
   geom_jitter(aes(color=party), alpha=1/20,position= position_jitter(h=0))+
  xlab("Candidate Name")+
  ylab("Contribution amounts")+
 # geom_point(aes(color=gender),alpha=1/20, position= position_jitter(h=0), 
  coord_cartesian( ylim=c(0,2500))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))+
  scale_color_manual(breaks = c("R", "D"), values=c("blue", "red"))+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, alpha=1, linetype =5)
```

This scatter plot helps us visualize that the most contributions are below $250. 
There is a good number of donations for amounts $500, $1000 and $2250

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
wa$contbr_zip<- clean.zipcodes(wa$contbr_zip)
contrib.zip<-aggregate(data.frame(count=wa$contb_receipt_amt),
                       list(zip=wa$contbr_zip),length)
contrib<- merge(contrib.zip, zipcode, by='zip')
contrib_wa <- subset(contrib, state=='WA')
states <- map_data("state")

wa_state <- subset(states, region %in% c("washington"))

```

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(contrib_wa,aes(longitude,latitude)) +
  geom_polygon(data=wa_state,aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group),color='black',
               fill='light green',alpha=.35)+
  geom_point(aes(color=count ), alpha =1, size=2) +
 # theme_awhstin(grid=F)
 xlim(-125,-115)+ylim(45,50)+
scale_colour_gradient(low = "pink", high = "dark red")

```

In WA state significant number of contributions came from zipcodes in and 
around Seattle. The second highest contributions seems to be from Spokane area


```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(wa, aes(x=contb_receipt_amt)) + geom_density(aes(color=party))+
  scale_x_continuous(limit= c(0,600), breaks=seq(0,600,100))+
  scale_color_manual(breaks = c("R", "D"), values=c("blue", "red"))
```

The density curve shows democrats have high probability of receiving modest 
contributions compared to Republicans.

###Create a linear regression model to predict contribution amounts
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
m1 = lm(contb_receipt_amt ~    cand_nm  + gender + contbr_zip  , data=wa)
```

m1 = lm(contb_receipt_amt ~    cand_nm  + gender + contbr_zip  , data=wa)
R-squared is 0.069 and it doesn't seem to be a very strong model.  Given that 
contribution amounts vary a lot, it is very hard to predict it using a simple 
linear model. This is the best linear model that is possible for this data.

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the 
###investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of 
###looking at your feature(s) of interest?

More females donated to Hillary Clinton than males, for all other candidates 
number of male contributions are higher than females.

Most contributions are for below $250

Significant number of contributions came from zip codes /cities in and around 
Seattle.  Next highest number of contributions is around Spokane area.


### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?
More number contributions came from urban areas compared to rural areas.

### OPTIONAL: Did you create any models with your dataset? Discuss the strengths
###and limitations of your model.
Created a linear model to predict the contribution amounts. However it is a 
very weak model with R-square value of 0.069. Given that contribution amounts 
vary a lot, it is hard to predict it using a linear model.

# Final Plots and Summary

### Plot One
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  ggplot(wa, aes(x=cand_nm)) +
  geom_histogram(stat= "count",color='black',fill='light blue')+
  geom_text(stat='count',aes(label=..count..),vjust=-1)+
  xlab("Candidate Name")+
  ylab("Number of Contributions received")+
  scale_y_continuous(limit= c(0,110000))+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))+
ggtitle("2008 Election - Number of contributions received by candidate")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold", hjust=0.5))
```

### Description One
This plot shows the energy and passion people had for Barack Obama and it 
reflected in the overwhelming number of contributions he received compared to 
other candidates.

### Plot Two

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  ggplot(aes(x=cand_nm, y=(contribution_mean)), data=wa.by_candnm)+
  geom_bar(aes(), fill = "light blue", color = 'black', group=1 ,
           stat="identity", position='dodge')+
  ylab("Contribution mean in $")+
  xlab("Candidate Name")+
  ggtitle("2008 Election - mean contributions received by candidate")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold", hjust=0.5))

```
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
 ggplot(aes(x=cand_nm, y=contribution_total/1000000), data=wa.by_candnm)+
  geom_bar(aes(), fill = "light blue", color = 'black', group=1 ,stat="identity",
           position='dodge')+
  ylab("Total contributions received in millions" )+
  xlab("Candidate Name")+
  ggtitle("2008 Election - mean contributions received by candidate")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold", hjust=0.5))
```

### Description Two
The plots above show that the mean contributions are much higher for Republican 
candidates Mitt Romney being the highest.
Even though mean contributions for democrats are lower, the contributions totals 
are much higher compared to Republicans. Barack Obama received $15 million 
compared to John McCain's $2.5 million.

### Plot Three
```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(contrib_wa,aes(longitude,latitude)) +
  geom_polygon(data=wa_state,aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group),color='black',
               fill='light green',alpha=.35)+
  geom_point(aes(color=count ), alpha =1, size=2) +
 # theme_awhstin(grid=F)
 xlim(-125,-115)+ylim(45,50)+
scale_colour_gradient(low = "pink", high = "dark red")+
  ggtitle("2008 Election - Number of contributions by zipcode")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(lineheight=.8, face="bold", hjust=0.5))
 
```

### Description Three
This plot above shows that most number of contributions came from in and around 
Seattle zipcodes. Next highest contributions are from Spokane area.  This 
implies that cotributions from urban areas is much higher than rural areas.

# Reflection
The 2008 election contribution data set for WA state contains 147149 
observations and 18 variables.  I reviewed the summary of the dataset and 
removed refunds and reattributions to eliminate double counting. I also removed
the columns that are not helpful for the analysis to reduce the size of the 
dataset.  Then I chose to add couple of columns (gender and party) to help with
the analysis.  I further removed the records for the candidates who received 
less than 500 contributions.   The final dataset I used for analysis contained 
130260 observations and 13 variables.

My main struggle was to try and create a density map for contributions using
zipcodes. However, I was not able to merge this with county data to be able to
create a heatmap. So I chose to show summarize counts by zipcode with color 
gradient.  All other transformations performed were realtively easy.


Since WA State leans toward democrats, I was expecting to see higher 
contributions for democrats.  However, the analysis showed that mean 
contribution amount is higher for republicans. But the number of contributions
received by democrats is way higher than republicans, which is expected.  Also
Barack Obama received $15million in total contributions compared to $2.5 
million for John McCain.   I was surprised to see such a significant difference
between the final two candidates.  Also it was good to see both females and 
males showed equal enthusiasm in their participation in election contributions.


I created a linear model to predict contribution amounts based on the variables
gender, zipcode and candidate name. It turned out that it is a weak model with 
R-squared 0.069.   I expected adding  Party will improve the model, but didn't
make a difference.   Given that contribution amounts vary a lot, it will be 
very hard to predict it with a simple linear model. A different type of model 
should be considered in the future.  Further analysis can be done based on 
contributor's occupation, but the data will need lot of clean up before 
analysis.
